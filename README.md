A strain finding and user review web application for use in states where cannabis is legal.

Currently have a simple review app.
I want to bring in my client side application which consists of getting JSON data via an API and rendering that 
data as markers on Google Maps API when a user searches for a strain. These markers are dispensary locations where the strain
can be found, in legal states where laws have been passed to allow the medical and/or recreational consumption of cannabis.
